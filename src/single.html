            <p class="page-single__text">Crypto is seemingly hanging in the balance and the marketâ€™s future is as uncertain as crypto is volatile. There is absolutely no way of telling with absolute certainty what will become of crypto. However, considering some of the factors surrounding the current meltdown may help in making educated predictions.</p>
            <!-- <p class="page-single__text">First, it is worth mentioning that it was mainly external factors that brought about the current collapse. With the exception of the Terra incident, there have not been any significant failures in the structure and design of crypto as technology. The concept of crypto and a decentralized economy is thus still viable. That being the case, how did we find ourselves fighting the worst crypto winter yet?</p>
            <p class="page-single__text">While crypto has reached some significant milestones, it has also suffered some backlash from institutions as well entire countries. Concerns about the environmental impacts of crypto have been on the rise, so much so that Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla, said that the company would stop accepting Bitcoin as payment because mining Bitcoin requires too much fossil fuel-generated electricity. This and similar events caused a more rapid decline in the price of Bitcoin. </p>
            <p class="page-single__text">Additionally, some governments, in addition to the environmental impacts of crypto mining, are concerned about the role crypto and blockchain technology play in fraudulent activities and money laundering schemes. China is just one country that placed a ban on crypto and started pushing its own centralized digital currency. This contributed to reduced activity in the crypto space. </p>
            <p class="page-single__text">All these events coupled with the hiking of interest rates by federal reserves in response to the inflation caused by adverse world events led to investors losing confidence in the crypto market and instead choosing to invest in other less risky assets. Crypto being a sentiment-driven market did not respond well to this and the situation worsened.</p>
